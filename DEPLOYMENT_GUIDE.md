# DEPLOYMENT & SUBMISSION GUIDE

**HNG DevOps Stage 1 - Quick Start**

---

## üéØ Quick Summary

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for:

1. Setting up your GitHub repository
2. Preparing your Docker project
3. Running the deployment script
4. Submitting to HNG

---

## Part 1: GitHub Repository Setup

### Step 1.1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `hng-devops-stage1` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Description:** "Automated Docker deployment script for HNG DevOps internship"
4. Select **Public** (HNG will need to access it)
5. Initialize with README (optional, we'll overwrite it)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 1.2: Get Your Repository URL

After creating the repo, you'll see a screen like this:

```
HTTPS:  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hng-devops-stage1.git
SSH:    git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/hng-devops-stage1.git
```

**Copy the HTTPS URL** - you'll need it in the next step.

---

## Part 2: Prepare Your Local Repository

### Step 2.1: Initialize Git in Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /home/freeman/HNG/devops/stage1

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Configure git (use your GitHub username and email)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: HNG DevOps Stage 1 deployment script"

# Add remote repository (replace URL with yours)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hng-devops-stage1.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2.2: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hng-devops-stage1`
2. Verify you see:
   - `deploy.sh`
   - `README.md`
   - `.gitignore`

‚úÖ You should see all three files listed!

---

## Part 3: Test the Script (Recommended)

### Option A: Dry Run Without Deployment

Test the script's help and basic functionality:

```bash
cd /home/freeman/HNG/devops/stage1

# Show help
./deploy.sh --help

# This should display usage information
```

### Option B: Full Deployment Test (Recommended)

If you have a test server available:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Then provide test values:

- Git repo: A test Docker project
- PAT: Your GitHub token
- Branch: main
- Remote user: ubuntu (or your server user)
- Server IP: Your test server IP
- SSH key: Your SSH key path
- Port: 3000 (or your app port)

Monitor the output for any errors. All logs are saved to `logs/deploy_*.log`

---
